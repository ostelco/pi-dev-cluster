# Circleci Pipeline

The pipeline manages the GKE clusters for both **DEV** and **PROD** environments.

## Google Projects

For complete separation and better access control, the **DEV** and **PROD** clusters are created in two different Google cloud projects. Namely, `pi-ostelco-dev` & `pi-ostelco-prod`.

The production cluster (and it's project) will only be accessible by admins or other team members who are delegated to cover for admins.

## Branches

There are two long lived branches (they are not meant to be merged): 

- dev : the **DEV** cluster is managed from this branch
- master : the **PROD** cluster is managed from this branch.

## Circleci config

Circleci [config](../.circleci/config.yml) is available under `.circleci/`

### the pipeline steps

The steps are the same for both the **DEV** & **PROD** clusters. 

`run terraform plan` --> `wait for a manual approval of the plan in circleci` --> `if approved, apply the changes with terraform plan and copy/update cluster certificates and keys to a Google bucket`


### circleci docker image

The docker image used in the circleci pipeline needs the following tools:

- Terraform
- gcloud

It is created and pushed to Google Container Registry (GCR) manually. The image is called: `eu.gcr.io/pi-ostelco-dev/terraform-gcloud:11.7` where `11.7` is the Terraform version.  It is created with a [dockerfile](../.circleci/Dockerfile) and has an [entrypoint script](../.circleci/docker-entrypoint.sh) which reads Google credentials from environment variables, stores it inside the container in `/tmp/credentials.json` and authenticates to Google Cloud using it.

### other CI/CD scripts

- [store_cluster_certs.sh](../.circleci/store_cluster_certs.sh) : copies the cluster certificates and keys which are retrieved by Terraform output to a Google cloud storage bucket.

### circleci environment variables
