## The intent if this script is to be a wrapper for other scripts,
## that is run as activated from a particular service account.   To run
## this script set the CLUSTER environment variable to either "dev" or "prod"
## depending on which of the clusters are being addressed.   Also ensure that
## either  the PI_DEV_GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS or PI_PROD_GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS variables
## are set.

## NOTE:  After having run this script will have a leave the credentials
##        stored in the PI_*_GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS environment variable in the
##        file /tmp/credentials.json.    It would be prudent to
##        ensure that this file is deleted after use, but at this time it
##        isn't.
